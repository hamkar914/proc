# proc<br>
A python/processing pipeline for 1D/pseudo 2D nmr data.<br><br>
For topspin:<br>
hkmft.py = FT a series of spectra from a pseudo 2D experiment<br>
hkreg1d.py = extract a 1D spectrum+paramters as a .txt file<br>
hkregps2d.py = extract 1D spectra from pesudo 2D as .txt<br><br>
For python:<br>
comp1d.py = deconvolute and plot 1d spectra, extract integrals<br>
hkdconps2d.py = deconvolute and plot a series of 1d spectra from pseudo 2D, extract integrals<br>
hkcrpptx.py = put a number deconvoluted 1D spectra as pngs into pptx file
